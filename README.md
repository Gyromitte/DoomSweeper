Basically a minesweeper game in iOS with a doom reskin

I made the game in basically like 2 days for a school assigment, dont expect nothing special

If you want to play it just download the zip and open it in xCode

I probbably will not be able to update the project or accept changes because i dont have a mac myself.


Known bugs and other things: You can explode in the first selected tile and i haven tested the landscape feature
